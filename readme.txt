Add unpaid bookings to Google Calendar sync (default only syncs completed, confirmed and paid statuses).

== Description ==

Include unpaid bookings in Google Calendar synchronization, to ensure bookings waiting for payments are already blocked in external calendars.

Useful if your policy is to set an option for booking requests, or if you collect payments later.

This is a simple implementation, as documented on https://woocommerce.com/document/google-calendar-integration/#section-7

== Installation ==

There are no settings, simply activate the plugin to include unpaid orders to calendar sync, or disable it to restore default behavior.
